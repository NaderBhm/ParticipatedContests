# 🏆 Odoo International Programming Contest

I recently participated in the **Odoo International Programming Contest (Online)** after discovering it randomly on the internet. It was a challenging competition with a very high skill ceiling.

Although I didn’t make it into the top 100, I pushed myself and managed to solve **3 problems** during the contest. It was a valuable experience that sharpened my problem-solving skills and tested my ability to think under pressure.
